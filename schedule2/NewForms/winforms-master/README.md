AdamsLair.WinForms
==================

A collection of custom Controls for Windows.Forms. These include:

* A custom **ColorPicker** Dialog, similar to the one known from software like Photoshop, but also supporting alpha values.
* A custom **PropertyGrid** Control, aimed to be highly extensible.
* **TiledView**, a model / view based Control to display large amounts of items in a tiled grid.
* A **model / view** separated representation of **MenuStrips** that can be used to display the same menu structure in MenuStrips, ContextMenus or submenus and react to events caused by it. Can easily be extended to include Tool- and StatusStrips as well.
